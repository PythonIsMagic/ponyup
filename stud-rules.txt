Rules of 5/7 card stud:
* small ante and bring-in.
* home games, typical -- ante only.
- begins with two cards face down and one card face up.
- lowest-ranking upcard pays the bring-in
- The bring-in is considered an open, so the next player in turn may not check.
- If two players have equally ranked low cards, suit may be used to break the
tie and assign the bring-in 

(see high card by suit).

- If there is no bring-in, then the first betting round begins with the player
showing the highest-ranking upcard, who may check.
- In this case, suit is not used to break ties.
- If two players have the same high upcard, the one first in clockwise rotation
from the dealer acts first.
- upcards are dealt to each player (after burn card), followed by a 2nd betting
round beginning with the player whose upcards make the best poker hand. 
- On this and all subsequent betting rounds, the player whose face-up cards
make the best poker hand will act first.


*** Exhausting the deck
- 7 cards to 8 players plus 4 burn cards = 60 cards
- only 52 in the deck.
- If the deck does become exhausted, previously-dealt burn cards can be used
when only a few cards are needed to complete the deal.
- If even those are not sufficient, then on the final round, a single community
card is dealt on the table.
- Discarded cards from a folded hand are not reused.
- Stud poker players use the info they get from face-up cards to make strategic
decisions, and so a player who sees a certain card folded is able to make
decisions knowing that the card will never appear in another opponent's hand.


*** Variants

A common variant called "Mississippi Stud" removes the betting round between
fourth and fifth streets, making only four betting rounds. This game also deals
the final card face up. This makes the game more closely resemble Texas Hold'em
by having the same betting structure and same number of down and up cards.

Another is "Roll your own", in which four rounds of two cards each are dealt
down, and each player must "roll" one card to face up, followed by a round of
betting. Except for the first round, the card rolled may or may not be from the
round just dealt.

*** High card by suit.

* When suit ranking is applied, the two most common conventions are:
Ascending alphabetical order: 
    clubs (lowest), diamonds, hearts, and spades (highest).

Alternating colors: 
    diamonds (lowest), followed by clubs, hearts, and spades (highest).

* Breaking ties in a chip race

During poker tournaments, a chip race is used to "color up" large numbers of
smaller-denomination chips, and a modified deal is used to assign leftover
chips. Ties in the deal are broken by suit.


*** 5 card stud:
Five-card stud is sometimes played no limit and pot limit, though fixed limit
and spread limit games are common (with higher limits in the later betting
rounds). It is typical to use a small ante and a bring-in.
