"""
The Session object manages the general structure of a poker cash game session.

It is responsible for:
    * knowing the game type,
    * the table,
    * the stakes,
    * keeping track of how many rounds have been played.
    * keeping track of how long the session has lasted.
    * keeping a handhistory log of all rounds played
    * Keeping track of when and what players get knocked out, for purposes of altering the
    blind tokens if necessary.
