"""
Simulates a standard game of War. Players each start with a 27 card stack, 2 jokers included.
Each player plays a card and tries to beat the rank of the other. The winner keeps the 2 cards.
If two cards of the same rank are played, a "War" round is played where 3 additional cards are
set down by each player, and a final determining card is played for all 10 cards. If these
cards tie for rank, we proceed to an additional level of War and so on. Play ends when one
player has won all the cards.

Other clarification:
* If a player runs out of cards they lose.
* If a player draws a last card for war that is an exception.
